# Aim-Shooting-Bot
## ABSTRACT

The aim of the project is to make a moving bot that will shoot at the target.

The gun is mounted on a platform which will give rotation about one axis and other rotation of the gun will be about the axis in perpendicular direction.

There will be a phone(1) mounted on the bot which will take real time video of the surrounding.

That phone(1) will also give signal to the arduino for controlling the bot.

Video will be live streamed to another phone(2) that will be controlled by the user.

Video coming to user phone(2) will be mapped to real coordinates via image processing.

User can click on any point on the screen at which he wants to shoot.

Then the coordinates of that point will get transferred to other phone(1) using wifi and that phone(1) will give the signal to the arduino.

Then the gun will adjust accordingly with the help of motion along given two axis using 2 servo motors and will shoot at the target.
